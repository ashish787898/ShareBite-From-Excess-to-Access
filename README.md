"ShareBite: A Smart Food Redistribution Platform to Combat Waste and Hunger"
ðŸ§  Project Overview: Food Share Platform
You're building a web-based platform that connects hotels, restaurants, and individuals who have surplus food with NGOs, volunteers, or helpers who can collect and distribute that food to those in need. This system helps reduce food wastage and promotes food donation efficiency, especially in smart cities.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
In many cities, a significant amount of food is wasted daily by restaurants, hotels, and caterers. Meanwhile, millions go hungry. There is no streamlined system to connect food donors with distributors quickly and reliably. Your platform aims to fill this gap.

ðŸ”¹ Objective
To design and implement an intuitive and scalable web-based food-sharing platform that allows:

Hotels/restaurants to post available surplus food.

Helpers/volunteers to view posts and take responsibility for pickup and distribution.

Reduce food waste and hunger simultaneously.
